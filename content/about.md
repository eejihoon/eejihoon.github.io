## About homebrewlab Blog

> "I try not to forget that what I've learned is just a small and superficial part.
> New technologies are good, but I believe it's also important to reflect on what I already know or thought I knew.
> I want to share what I newly discover in that process through this blog.
> Just as I learn a lot from discussing problems with colleagues and seeing diverse perspectives,
> I hope this space can also be a place to learn and grow together."

Previously, I maintained a blog at [coco-log.tistory.com](https://coco-log.tistory.com/), where I have written over 200 posts since 2020, sharing my learning journey and insights.

**homebrewlab** is my new small lab and a space for recording my learning process, practical experiences, and various thoughts.
I plan to freely include not only technical knowledge but also the concerns and growth process I experience as a developer, and reflections on various topics.

- **Wiki:** Technical documents, concept summaries, learning notes
- **Tech Posts:** Sharing practical experiences, problem-solving processes, tutorials
- **Essays:** Development culture, personal thoughts, retrospectives
